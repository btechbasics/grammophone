# Grammophone

This is a client-side web app for analyzing and transforming context-free grammars. It was developed with the support and guidance of [Robin Cockett](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/) at the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca), and it's based on his [Context Free Grammar Checker](http://smlweb.cpsc.ucalgary.ca).
